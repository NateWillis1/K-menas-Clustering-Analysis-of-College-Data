In the ever-increasing competitiveness of the modern higher education landscape, gaining a better understanding of the incredibly diverse and multifaceted characteristics that distinguish institutions is crucial for prospective students, institutions themselves, and policymakers.

Colleges and universities vary vastly in terms of academic rigor, culture, size, financial structuring, demographic, and faculty makeup. This variation presents a challenge, but also an opportunity, to better understand these differences and manage policy and strategy in terms of educational offerings, outcomes, and other factors that affect the well-being of students and the success of institutions.

This dataset contains 777 different universities with a wide range of cost, prestige, academic rigor, size, culture, and other factors. This complexity of characteristics can make it difficult to identify trends or groupings between universities. Using a k-means clustering algorithm, however, we are able to identify key groupings of institutions which could allow individuals to make better informed decisions regarding a given institution
